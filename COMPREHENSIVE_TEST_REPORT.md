## 🔍 Known Limitations & Areas for Improvement

### Integration Testing
**Status:** ⚠️ Limited
- Integration tests (like `test_parts_complete.py`) require a running server
- These tests are designed for deployment verification
- Recommendation: Set up CI/CD pipeline to run integration tests against test deployment

### Database Permissions
**Status:** ⚠️ Configuration Required
- Production paths (`/var/lib/chatterfix/`) require elevated permissions
- Test environment successfully uses local database files
- Recommendation: Document deployment requirements for production directories

### Performance Testing
**Status:** ℹ️ Framework Available
- Locust performance testing framework configured
- Tests located in `tests/performance/locustfile.py`
- Recommendation: Run load tests as part of pre-production validation

---
