## 📝 Pre-Merge Checklist

Before merging the pull request, ensure:

- [ ] All CI/CD checks pass

- [ ] Documentation is up to date
- [ ] Breaking changes are documented
- [ ] Deployment plan is ready

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Branch Protection**: If the `main` branch has protection rules, you may need:
   - Required reviews
   - Status checks to pass
   - Admin privileges to override

2. **Merge Conflicts**: If there are conflicts between `main` and `main-clean`:
   ```bash
   git checkout main-clean
   git merge main
   # Resolve conflicts
   git commit
   git push origin main-clean
   ```

3. **Deployment**: After merging, the production deployment workflow may trigger automatically.

4. **Backup**: Consider creating a backup or tag of the current `main` branch:
   ```bash
   git tag -a backup-pre-clean-merge -m "Backup before clean merge"
   git push origin backup-pre-clean-merge
   ```
