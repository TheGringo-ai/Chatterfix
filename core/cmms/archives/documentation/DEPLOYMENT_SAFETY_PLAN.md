# ChatterFix CMMS Deployment Safety Plan

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT REGRESSION RESOLVED

**Date:** October 3, 2025
**Issue:** Older version deployed instead of professional landing page
**Status:** âœ… RESOLVED
**Current Live Site:** https://chatterfix.com (Professional Landing Page)

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### What Happened
1. **Multiple Deployment Scripts**: Found 16+ deployment scripts in the repository
2. **Resource Conflicts**: CPU quota exceeded due to too many running services
3. **Version Confusion**: Old app version was serving from Cloud Run instead of new professional landing page
4. **Email Error**: Wrong email address (yoyofred@chatterfix.com) instead of correct (yoyofred@gringosgambit.com)

### What Was Fixed
1. âœ… Cleaned up unused Cloud Run services (freed resources)
2. âœ… Fixed email addresses in app.py
3. âœ… Successfully deployed professional landing page
4. âœ… Verified live site shows correct content

## Deployment Safety Protocols

### 1. Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] **Version Control**: Ensure git status is clean
- [ ] **File Verification**: Confirm app.py contains professional landing page (not old dashboard)
- [ ] **Email Check**: Verify all email references use yoyofred@gringosgambit.com
- [ ] **Resource Check**: Ensure sufficient Cloud Run CPU quota
- [ ] **Service Cleanup**: Remove unused services before deployment

### 2. Deployment Process
```bash
# 1. Pre-deployment verification
curl -s https://chatterfix.com | head -5  # Check current version
gcloud run services list --region=us-central1  # Check resources

# 2. Deploy with safe settings
gcloud run deploy chatterfix-cmms \
    --source . \
    --platform managed \
    --region us-central1 \
    --allow-unauthenticated \
    --port 8080 \
    --memory 512Mi \
    --cpu 1 \
    --timeout 300 \
    --max-instances 2 \
    --min-instances 0

# 3. Post-deployment verification
curl -s https://chatterfix.com | grep "Revolutionary AI-Powered"
curl -s https://chatterfix.com | grep "yoyofred@gringosgambit.com"
```

### 3. Verification Steps
1. **Title Check**: Must show "ChatterFix CMMS - Revolutionary AI-Powered Maintenance Management"
2. **Email Check**: All email references must use yoyofred@gringosgambit.com
3. **Landing Page**: Must show professional design with email signup form
4. **Health Check**: Verify /health endpoint responds correctly

### 4. Rollback Procedure
If deployment fails or regression occurs:
```bash
# 1. Check current revisions
gcloud run revisions list --service=chatterfix-cmms --region=us-central1

# 2. Rollback to previous working revision
gcloud run services update-traffic chatterfix-cmms \
    --to-revisions=PREVIOUS_REVISION=100 \
    --region=us-central1

# 3. Verify rollback worked
curl -s https://chatterfix.com | head -5
```

## Resource Management

### Cloud Run Services Inventory
**Currently Running (Essential):**
- chatterfix-cmms (Main UI Gateway) - **PRODUCTION**
- chatterfix-ai-brain (AI Services)
- chatterfix-assets (Asset Management)
- chatterfix-parts (Parts Inventory)
- chatterfix-work-orders (Work Order Management)
- chatterfix-database (Database Service)
- chatterfix-document-intelligence (Document Processing)
- chatterfix-storage-api (Storage API)

- ~~chatterfix-llama-api~~ (Unused, removed)

### CPU Quota Management
- **Monitor Usage**: Regularly check quota usage
- **Service Cleanup**: Remove unused services immediately
- **Resource Limits**: Use minimal but sufficient resources (512Mi RAM, 1 CPU)
- **Scaling Policy**: min-instances=0, max-instances=2 for cost efficiency

---

## File Structure & Version Control

### Critical Files
- **app.py**: Main application file (MUST contain professional landing page)
- **deploy-chatterfix.sh**: Primary deployment script
- **Dockerfile**: Container configuration

### Backup Strategy
```bash
# Before any major changes, create backup
cp app.py app.py.backup.$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
git add . && git commit -m "Backup before deployment"
```

### Deployment Scripts Audit
**Primary Scripts (Keep):**
- deploy-chatterfix.sh (Main deployment)
- deploy-main-ui-gateway.sh (Alternative deployment)

**Secondary Scripts (Review/Consolidate):**
- 14+ other deployment scripts need review and possible consolidation

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Health Checks
- **Automated**: Monitor /health endpoint every 5 minutes
- **Manual**: Verify landing page content after each deployment
- **Email Test**: Ensure email signup form works correctly

### Performance Monitoring
- **Response Time**: < 2 seconds for landing page
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability target
- **Error Rate**: < 1% error rate

### Alert Conditions
1. **Service Down**: Immediate alert if chatterfix.com is unreachable
2. **Wrong Content**: Alert if old dashboard content is detected
3. **Email Error**: Alert if wrong email domain is found
4. **Resource Quota**: Alert when approaching CPU limits

## Testing Protocol

### Before Each Deployment
1. **Local Testing**: Verify app.py runs locally on port 8080
2. **Content Check**: Confirm professional landing page loads
3. **Email Verification**: Check all email links point to @gringosgambit.com
4. **Resource Check**: Ensure sufficient Cloud Run quota

### After Each Deployment

3. **Email Test**: Submit test email through signup form
4. **Performance Test**: Check page load time < 2 seconds

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Resource Management**: Keep only essential services running
2. **Single Source of Truth**: Use one primary deployment script
3. **Pre-deployment Checks**: Always verify current state before deploying
4. **Post-deployment Verification**: Immediate content verification is critical
5. **Documentation**: Keep deployment process well-documented

---

## Future Improvements

1. **Automated Testing**: Implement CI/CD pipeline with automated tests
2. **Staging Environment**: Create staging environment for testing
3. **Infrastructure as Code**: Move to Terraform for resource management
4. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Create real-time monitoring dashboard
5. **Automated Rollback**: Implement automatic rollback on deployment failure
