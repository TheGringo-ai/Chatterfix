# ChatterFix CMMS - Bulletproof Deployment Integration

## üéØ What's Been Implemented

Your VM deployment is now **enterprise-grade bulletproof** with atomic releases and automatic rollback.

### ‚úÖ Core Improvements Applied

1. **Enhanced Health Checks** - `app.py` now includes:
   - `/health` - Deep component validation (DB, Ollama, AI endpoints)
   - `/ready` - Strict readiness probe with AI processing test
   - Proper HTTP status codes (503 for unhealthy)
   - Deploy ID tracking for release correlation

2. **Configurable LLaMA Client** - Environment-driven configuration:
   - `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` (default: http://localhost:11434)
   - `OLLAMA_MODEL` (default: llama3.1:8b)
   - No more hardcoded values

3. **Atomic Deployment System**:
   - Timestamped releases in `/opt/chatterfix-cmms/releases/`
   - Symlink-based activation via `/opt/chatterfix-cmms/current`
   - Auto-backup (code + SQLite) before each deploy
   - Automatic rollback on any failure

## üöÄ New Deployment Arsenal

| Script | Purpose | Usage |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `bulletproof-deployment.sh` | Main production deployment | `./bulletproof-deployment.sh` |
| `emergency-rollback.sh` | One-command disaster recovery | `./emergency-rollback.sh` |
| `vm-setup-once.sh` | One-time VM initialization | `./vm-setup-once.sh` |
| `test-deployment.sh` | Pre-deployment validation | `./test-deployment.sh` |
| `chatterfix-cmms.service` | Production systemd unit | Auto-installed by scripts |
| `chatterfix-cmms.env` | Environment configuration | Auto-installed by scripts |
| `migrate-database.sh` | Database migration utility | `./migrate-database.sh` (existing VMs) |

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

- **Pre-flight Checks**: Validates Ollama, models, and syntax before deployment
- **Readiness Gates**: 15-retry health validation with 2s backoff
- **Automatic Rollback**: Any failure triggers immediate rollback to previous release
- **Process Safety**: Graceful shutdown with SIGTERM, SIGKILL only as last resort
- **Database Security**: SQLite in `/var/lib` with systemd-managed permissions
- **Database Backups**: SQLite snapshot before every deployment
- **Release Pruning**: Keep last 5 releases, auto-cleanup older ones

## üîß VM Deployment Steps

### One-Time Setup (on VM)
```bash
# 1. Copy deployment files to VM
scp *.sh *.service *.env user@vm:/opt/chatterfix-cmms/

# 2. Run one-time setup script (creates user, directories, installs service)
./vm-setup-once.sh

# 3. For existing VMs only: migrate database to secure location
./migrate-database.sh  # Only if upgrading existing deployment
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Deploy new release
./bulletproof-deployment.sh

# If something goes wrong
./emergency-rollback.sh

# Monitor
journalctl -u chatterfix-cmms -f
```

## üß™ Validation Endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose | Expected Response |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| `/health` | Component health | `{"status": "healthy", "components": {...}}` |
| `/ready` | Readiness probe | `{"status": "ready"}` |
| `/ai-inject.js` | AI injection script | JavaScript code (HTTP 200) |

## üéñÔ∏è Production Grade Benefits

‚úÖ **Zero-Downtime Deployments** - Symlink swaps are atomic  
‚úÖ **Automatic Rollback** - No more broken weekends  
‚úÖ **Pre-flight Validation** - Catch issues before production  
‚úÖ **Security Hardening** - Dedicated user, no root execution  
‚úÖ **Database Security** - SQLite in `/var/lib` with `ProtectSystem=full`  
‚úÖ **Proper Virtual Environments** - Correct venv paths and isolation  
‚úÖ **Comprehensive Monitoring** - Deep health checks for automation  
‚úÖ **Audit Trail** - Deploy ID tracking in logs and metrics  
‚úÖ **Data Safety** - SQLite backups before every change  

## üéØ What Changed From Original

| Original | Bulletproof |
|----------|-------------|
| In-place updates | Atomic releases with symlinks |
| Hope-based deployment | Pre-flight validation + rollback |
| Basic `/health` | Deep component validation |
| Manual process management | Systemd-managed with proper timeouts |
| No backups | Automatic SQLite + code snapshots |
| Single deployment script | Complete deployment toolkit |

Your deployment now has **enterprise-grade reliability**. Deployments either succeed completely or rollback automatically - no middle ground.

## üîç Quick Smoke Test
```bash
# Test locally first
./test-deployment.sh

# Deploy to production
./bulletproof-deployment.sh

# Validate health
curl http://localhost:8000/ready | jq

# Test rollback (if needed)
./emergency-rollback.sh
```

üéâ **Your VM deployment is now bulletproof and production-ready!**
