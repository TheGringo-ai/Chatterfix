- Check motor current draw
- Inspect electrical connections
- Torque terminal connections to 12 ft-lbs

Quarterly Service:
- Perform vibration analysis
- Megger insulation resistance test (> 100 MΩ)
- Check bearing temperatures
- Clean motor housing and fan

Annual Overhaul:
- Replace bearings (SKF 6314-2RS front, 6312-2RS rear)
- Replace shaft seals
- Test windings for continuity
- Torque all fasteners per specification

SECTION 4: TROUBLESHOOTING

High Vibration:
1. Check coupling alignment (< 0.005" TIR)
2. Verify mounting bolt torque: 85 ft-lbs
3. Inspect for bearing wear
4. Balance rotor if necessary

Overheating:
1. Verify proper ventilation clearance (6" minimum)
2. Check motor loading (should be 75-85% rated current)
3. Inspect for blocked cooling passages
4. Measure ambient temperature (< 40°C)

Low Efficiency:
1. Check voltage balance (< 2% variation)
2. Verify frequency (60 Hz ± 1%)
3. Measure power factor (> 0.85 at full load)
4. Test rotor bar continuity
