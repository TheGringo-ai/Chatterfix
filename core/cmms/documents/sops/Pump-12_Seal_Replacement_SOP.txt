STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
Title: Pump-12 Mechanical Seal Replacement
SOP Number: SOP-PUMP-012
Revision: 2.1
Effective Date: 2024-01-15

SECTION 1: PURPOSE AND SCOPE

This SOP provides step-by-step instructions for replacing the mechanical seal on Pump-12 (Model P-500, Serial Number P12-2024-001).

Equipment: Centrifugal Process Pump P-500
Location: Building A, Pump Room 2
Safety Classification: Medium Risk

SECTION 2: TOOLS AND MATERIALS REQUIRED

Tools:
- Torque wrench (10-150 ft-lbs range)
- Socket set (10mm-19mm)
- Seal puller kit
- Feeler gauges
- Dial indicator
- Clean rags
- Safety glasses and gloves

Materials:
- Mechanical seal kit (Part #: SEAL-P500-001)
- O-ring set (Part #: ORING-P500-SET)
- Bearing grease (Mobilux EP2)
- Thread sealant (Loctite 567)
- Pump coupling (if replacement needed)

SECTION 3: SAFETY REQUIREMENTS

1. Obtain work permit from operations supervisor
2. Verify pump is isolated and tagged out
3. Confirm zero energy state with multimeter
4. Drain system pressure completely
5. Wear required PPE: safety glasses, gloves, steel-toed boots
6. Have spill containment materials ready

SECTION 4: PROCEDURE STEPS

Step 1: System Isolation
- Close inlet valve V-101
- Close outlet valve V-102  
- Open drain valve V-103 completely
- Verify pump motor is locked out at MCC-1A
- Attach LOTO tags per company procedure

Step 2: Pump Disassembly
- Disconnect coupling guard and coupling
- Remove pump mounting bolts (4 ea, 12mm)
- Carefully lift pump assembly using overhead hoist
- Place pump on clean work surface

Step 3: Seal Housing Access
- Remove seal housing cover (8 bolts, torque: 25 ft-lbs)
- Clean housing thoroughly with solvent
- Inspect housing for wear or damage
- Take photos for documentation

Step 4: Old Seal Removal
- Use seal puller to extract stationary seal face
- Remove O-rings from seal housing grooves
- Clean shaft and housing contact surfaces
- Check shaft runout with dial indicator (< 0.002" TIR)

Step 5: New Seal Installation
- Apply thin coat of grease to shaft
- Install new O-rings in housing grooves
- Carefully install new seal assembly
- Ensure proper seating and alignment
- Check seal face squareness with feeler gauge

Step 6: Reassembly
- Replace seal housing cover with new gasket
- Torque cover bolts in cross pattern to 25 ft-lbs
- Reinstall pump in original position
- Torque mounting bolts to 45 ft-lbs
- Reconnect coupling with proper alignment

Step 7: System Startup
- Remove LOTO tags and devices
- Slowly open inlet valve V-101
- Vent air from pump housing
- Start pump motor and check for leaks
- Monitor seal for proper operation (< 5 drops/minute)
- Document completion in maintenance log

SECTION 5: QUALITY CHECKS

Visual Inspection:
- No visible leaks at seal interface
- Proper coupling alignment (< 0.005" offset)
- All bolts torqued to specification
- No abnormal noise or vibration

Performance Verification:
- Operating pressure: 85-95 PSI
- Flow rate: 450-500 GPM
- Motor current: 18-22 Amps
- Seal leakage: < 5 drops per minute

SECTION 6: DOCUMENTATION

Complete the following:
- Maintenance work order with actual hours
- Parts usage record in CMMS system
- Digital photos of completed work
- Next maintenance due date calculation

Estimated Time: 4-6 hours
Required Personnel: 2 technicians (Level II minimum)
Next Service Due: 8760 operating hours or 12 months

NOTES:
- Seal replacement should be performed every 8760 hours or annually
- Always use genuine manufacturer parts
- Coupling alignment is critical for seal life
- Contact engineering if shaft runout exceeds 0.002"
