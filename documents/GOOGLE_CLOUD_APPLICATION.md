## What ChatterFix Does

ChatterFix is a **Technician-First CMMS (Computerized Maintenance Management System)** that eliminates manual data entry through AI-powered voice commands, OCR document scanning, and natural language processing.

### The Problem We Solve

Maintenance technicians spend **30% of their time on paperwork** instead of fixing equipment. Traditional CMMS systems are designed for managers at desks, not technicians in the field with dirty hands.

### Our Solution

- **Voice Commands:** "Create a work order for pump failure in Building A"
- **OCR Document Scanning:** Automatically capture data from equipment labels and paperwork
- **AI-Powered Insights:** Natural conversations to get department analytics
- **Hands-Free Operation:** Built for AR/smart glasses integration
- **Mobile-First:** Works in warehouse dead zones with offline queue
